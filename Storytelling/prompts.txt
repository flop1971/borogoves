AI Explainability Through Storytelling – 6e PromptsEstablish:For the following explanation of a Linear Regression model for a heart disease dataset, write a “Establish” paragraph with 50-150 words in a storytelling format that defines actor entities lexicons for a given set of techniques, and defines actor entities for a set of results relative to the accompanying technique. Consider including the following...* Describe/Introduce the role of a dependent variable* Describe/Introduce the role of an independent variable* Describe how a dependent/independent variable can be a cross-domain “characters”* Describe the problem domain and how it is relevant to the characters and the result.Note that a linear regression story should discuss how the independent variable characters are used to help their dependent variable characters provide a result. A linear regression story should begin with our two characters. Also, remember that the more detail you give about a character, the more important the reader expects them to be. Here’s the explanation of a Linear Regression model for a heart disease dataset....We know that heart disease affects many people around the world. Much studyhas been conducted by medical research. We know from intuition that doing moreexercise is good for you and smoking is bad for you. Imagine we collected information about the rate of heart disease in our local town from each individual and whether each person cycled a bike or smoked. Could we check for an association between cycling, smoking, and heart disease? Using multiple linear regression, we can accomplish such a task. As we want to check the relationship between cycling, smoking, and heart disease, we can label both cycling and smoking as independent and heart disease as the dependent variables. As we have three variables, this task is straightforward. Next, we shall look at the diagnostic results of the model.Once the model is fitted, our first point of interest is to see how well the fittedmodel represents the underlying dataset. Our first clue is the adjusted R-squaredvalue of 0.98. A value closer to one indicates great representation, while a valuecloser to 0 indicates little representation of the underlying data. Thankfully ourmodel shows excellent variability. The second point of interest is to check whether our independent variables have a statistically significant relationship with the dependent variable. A value of less than 0.05 indicates a meaningful relationship. Both independent variables have ascore of less than 0.05, which is a second clue that the model is shaping up nicely.Linear regression implies that a linear (straight line) is fitted between our datapoints. No single line can pass through all points precisely, so we measure thedistance between our model line and data points as “residuals”. Our third checkis to determine if the residuals of our data provide a linear shape. We can do thisin two ways the first is to use a graphical method which is not exact; the secondis to use a precise mathematical test. The graphical test shows that the residual shape is reasonably straight but not precisely perfect, while the formal test indicates that the residuals are not that straight. This result suggests that a linear regression model needs to be moretechnically valid. However, the model output could still be helpful.The fourth and final check we perform is to see if both the independent variablesare indeed independent. Using a variance inflation test measure, we found thateach variable scored 1, indicating independence. A score of greater than fivewould indicate dependence. As three of the four checks were respected, could westill use this model for a valid prediction? In summary, based on the 500 people we surveyed, we found significant relationships between the frequency of biking to work and the frequency of heartdisease, smoking, and heart disease. We found a 0.2% decrease in the frequencyof heart disease for every 1% increase in biking and a 0.178% increase in thefrequency of heart disease for every 1% increase in smoking.Now please write the “Establish” paragraph that we discussed. Empathize:For the following explanation of a Linear Regression model for a heart disease dataset, write a “Empathize” paragraph with 50-150 words in a storytelling format that defines the conflict or problem that requires us to use a specific technique. Consider the following...* The dependent variable doesn’t know what independent variables are needed to provide a useful prediction.* Do the variables require a transformation prior to model fitting to produce a useful result?* The key conflict is: can a suitable number of independent variables be used to predict a dependent?* External conflict could be independent variables that have a high (Pr > |t|) value.* Internal conflict could arise in the form of observations with high leverage or large standardized residuals* The moral conflict could multicollinearity (independent variables are unaware of their co-dependence)Here’s the explanation of a Linear Regression model for a heart disease dataset....We know that heart disease affects many people around the world.
